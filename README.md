# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-App

A web application for predicting multiple diseases using machine learning models like SVM and Logistic Regression. This project includes prediction models for Diabetes, Parkinson's Disease, and Heart Disease.

# MODELS USED:

Diabetes Model: This model predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on input features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc.

Parkinson's Disease Model: This model predicts the presence of Parkinson's disease in a person based on features extracted from voice recordings.

Heart Disease Model: This model predicts the presence of heart disease based on various clinical and demographic features of a person.
